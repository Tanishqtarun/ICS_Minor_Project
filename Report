Report on Voting System Code:-

->Overview:-
This code implements a simple voting system where users can input the number of candidates, their names, and then proceed to vote for their preferred candidate. The system allows users to display the list of candidates, vote for a candidate, display the voting results, and exit the system.

->Key Components:-

Candidate Structure:- Defines a structure to store candidate information including their name and the number of votes they received.

Initialization Function: Initializes the votes of all candidates to zero.

Display Functions: Display the list of candidates and the voting results.

Voting Function: Allows users to vote for a candidate, incrementing their vote count.

Main Function:- Controls the flow of the program, prompting users to input the number of candidates, their names, and allowing them to perform various actions such as voting and displaying results.

->Input Validation:-

The code validates the number of candidates entered by the user to ensure its within a valid range (greater than zero and less than or equal to MAX_CANDIDATES).

It also checks for valid candidate numbers when users vote to prevent selecting candidates that do not exist.

->User Interface:-

The program provides a simple menu interface for users to navigate through different options.
Users can input their choices using numerical options provided in the menu.
Improvements:

Error Handling: Improve error handling to handle invalid inputs more gracefully.
Security: Implement input validation for candidate names to prevent buffer overflow.
Flexibility: Allow dynamic memory allocation for candidates to support a larger number of candidates.
Additional Features: Add features such as candidate registration, removing candidates, or tallying votes by constituency.
Conclusion:-
Overall, the code provides a basic framework for a voting system. With some enhancements and additional features, it could be adapted for various voting scenarios, from simple polls to more complex elections.
